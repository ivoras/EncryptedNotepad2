# EncryptedNotepad2

This is a spiritual successor to the "Encrypted Notepad" app [previously developed on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/enotes/). The goal is still the same: "Encrypted Notepad 2" does only one thing, but aims to do it perfectly - a Notepad-like simple text editor where files are saved (and later loaded) encrypted with industrial strength algorithms. No ads, no network connection required, no bloat, just run it.

# Encrypted Notepad 2

This is a spiritual successor to the "Encrypted Notepad" app [previously developed on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/enotes/), by the same author. The goal is still the same: "Encrypted Notepad 2" does only one thing, but aims to do it perfectly - a Notepad-like simple text editor where files are saved (and later loaded) encrypted with industrial strength algorithms. No ads, no network connection required, no bloat, just run it. If you know how to use the ancient Notepad app, you will know how how to use this app.
